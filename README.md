A web app for managing your stock portfolio, inspired by the Canadian Couch Potato model.

The app was made with **React** and makes use of **AWS Amplify, Cognito, DynamoDB** as well as **Route 53** for the domain hosting.

##Overview
The app allows users to add, delete, and edit their stock holdings on the left hand side of the screen, as well as their target allocation for that holding within their portfolio.

The user can also declare their accounts and the amount within each account. These are the values which the app will use to calculate how much the user should put in each of their holdings when investing a given amount.
